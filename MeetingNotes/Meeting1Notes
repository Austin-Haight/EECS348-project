Meeting conducted on 2/10/26 @ 5:00pm

Attendees: Yecolia Ephraim, Eric Faltermeier, Austin Haight, Tugs-Oyut Tsedensodnom, Alexander Wichern

Not present: John Pannel (prior commitment)

In this meeting we outlined a Software Development Plan in alignment with the examples provided in 01-Project-Plan, then divided individual sections to write amongst team members. 
In addition we also assigned team rolls and made plans for future meetings. 

We decided that Eric would be the scrum master, myself (Alexander) and Yecolia would be note takers, Austin to be the file manager, and for John and Tugs to be programmers. 
However we did specify that these roles are subject to change and that everyone would contribute to the programming portions of the project.

We then divided up the work of the first deliverable into sections based on the sections outlined in the project plan template with everyone having a similar amount of work. 
After that we discussed tentative times for future meetings with Tuesdays/Thursdays at 5pm being a primary option.
